The chmod command in Unix/Linux is used to change the permissions of files and directories.

Basic Permissions
Each file or directory has three types of permissions for three categories of users:

Permissions:
r – read

w – write

x – execute

Categories:
u – user (owner)

g – group

o – others

a – all (user + group + others)

chmod [options] mode file

Numeric Mode (shorthand with numbers)
-----------------------------------------
Each permission has a numeric value:

r = 4

w = 2

x = 1

You sum them up for each user group.

chmod 755 filename
This means:

7 = 4+2+1 → read, write, execute (user)

5 = 4+0+1 → read, execute (group)

5 = 4+0+1 → read, execute (others)

Common numeric permissions:

777: everyone can read/write/execute

755: owner full access, others can read/execute

644: owner read/write, others read-only
