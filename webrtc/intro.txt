Webrtc vs Websockets:
====================
Websockets: Real-time communication through server.
webrtc: real-time communication between browsers.
		Data never touches server.
		webrtc transports its data through UDP. UDP is fast.

if webrtc is so fast, why do we need Websockets?
------------------------------------------------
UDP is not a reliable protocol for transfering the data.
UDP doesn't validate data.
No built in signaling.
