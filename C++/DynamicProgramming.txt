Dp on Grids / 2D Matrices:
--------------------------
count pairs
count pairs with obstacles
mininum path sum
max path sum (on some conditions we can solve using DP)
triangle 
2 start points

how to do the space optimization:
---------------------------------
suppose you are using 2d array in problems like 0/1 knapsack.
we can achive the result using 2 single dimentional arrays curr, prev.
Hence this way we can reduce the space taken.
