🧩 width / height
-----------------
Used in all types of layout (block, grid, flex, etc.)

In Flexbox, it's overridden by flex-basis (if both are set).
.item {
  width: 200px;
}

🧩 flex-basis
--------------
Controls the initial size of the item before grow/shrink happens.

Acts like width in row direction and height in column.

.item {
  flex-basis: 200px;
}
📦 The item starts at 200px, but can grow or shrink depending on the other flex-* properties.

⚠️ If you use both:
.item {
  width: 200px;
  flex-basis: 100px;
}
✅ In Flexbox, flex-basis takes priority.

🧠 Real Example
🔹 Using flex-basis
.item {
  flex: 1 1 200px; /* grow: 1, shrink: 1, basis: 200px */
}
📦 The item starts at 200px, but can grow/shrink based on space.

🔹 Using width
.item {
  width: 200px;
}
📦 The item will always be 200px, unless something overrides it.

✅ Use flex-basis when:
You're inside a Flexbox container

You want flexible sizing that starts at a specific size

You're using flex-grow and flex-shrink

🔥 Bonus Tip: Shorthand
flex: 1 1 200px;
/* = flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 200px; */
