rowGap - gap b/w rows.
columnGap - gap b/w columns.
gap: for both rowGap, columnGap.

align-items is a CSS property used with Flexbox and Grid layouts to control how items are aligned along the cross axis of the container.

ðŸ“Œ In Flexbox:
---------------
The main axis is the direction set by flex-direction (default is row).
The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.
So align-items controls vertical alignment when flex-direction: row, and horizontal alignment when flex-direction: column.
ðŸ’¡ Common Values for align-items:

Value	What it does
stretch	(Default) Stretches items to fill the container along the cross axis
flex-start	Aligns items to the start of the cross axis
flex-end	Aligns items to the end of the cross axis
center	Centers items along the cross axis
baseline	Aligns items by their text baseline
