🛠 What Are Vite and Webpack?
	Bundlers
	Take your source code (like .jsx, .scss, .ts) and turn it into optimized, browser-ready code.

🤔 Why Do We Need Them?
--------------------
Modern web apps use:	
	JSX / TSX (React, TypeScript)
	SCSS / CSS modules
	ES Modules (import/export)
	Code Splitting
	Image optimization
	Hot Reloading

Browsers don’t understand these things natively, so you need a tool to:

Task	Example
💥 Bundle	Combine all .js, .css, .img into 1+ files
🔁 Live Reload	Reload browser when code changes
📦 Transpile	Convert JSX / TS to regular JS
🔐 Env support	Env files
Builds optimized files for production

🆚 Vite vs Webpack – What's the Difference?
Feature	Vite	Webpack
🚀 Speed (Dev)	⚡ Super fast 	       🐢 Slower
🧠 Config	Simple out of the box	    Powerful but complex
🔁 HMR (Hot Reload)	Instant updates	    Slower reloads
🧱 Build Time (Prod)	Fast	        Medium


⚙️ Example: What Vite Does
-------------------------
You write this:
	import './styles.scss';
	import App from './App.jsx';

Vite:
	converts JSX to TS / Js
	Compiles SCSS → CSS
	Bundles imports
	Runs dev server with hot reload
	Builds optimized files for production

Concept	Answer
------- -------
Do we need a bundler?	✅ Yes, unless you're building super-basic HTML+JS
Should I use Vite or Webpack?	✅ Use Vite unless you need complex config or are working with legacy Webpack code
What if I use Next.js?	These use Webpack/Vite internally
