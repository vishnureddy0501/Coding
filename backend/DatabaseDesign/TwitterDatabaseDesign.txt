1. First principle of database design
So we don’t dump everything in one collection. We organize based on:

Access patterns (how data is queried most often).

Growth (some data grows large, better to separate).

Consistency (what needs to always be in sync).

2. Entities in Twitter

For Twitter, the main “things” are:

User → profile info

Tweet (Post) → text, images, videos, links

Comment → reply to a tweet

Follower/Following → relationship between users

Media (Images, Videos) → actual files or URLs

Likes/Retweets → interactions

3. Designing collections in MongoDB
(a) Users collection
{
  "_id": "user123", 
  "username": "vishnu",
  "email": "vishnu@example.com",
  "name": "Vishnu Reddy",
  "bio": "Backend learner 🚀",
  "address": {
    "city": "Hyderabad",
    "country": "India"
  },
  "followersCount": 120,
  "followingCount": 80
}


👉 Why separate? Because user info is reused everywhere (tweets, comments). If embedded inside tweets, updating a user (say username change) would be painful. So keep users separate.

(b) Tweets collection
{
  "_id": "tweet456",
  "userId": "user123",   // Reference to Users
  "content": "Learning MongoDB is 🔥",
  "media": [
    { "type": "image", "url": "https://cdn.com/pic1.png" },
    { "type": "video", "url": "https://cdn.com/vid1.mp4" }
  ],
  "links": ["https://example.com"],
  "createdAt": "2025-08-30T12:00:00Z",
  "likesCount": 50,
  "retweetsCount": 10
}


👉 Why?

Store media as URLs (actual files go to AWS S3, GCP, or similar).

Tweet is separate because it grows a lot (billions of tweets).

(c) Comments collection
{
  "_id": "comment789",
  "tweetId": "tweet456",  // Reference to tweet
  "userId": "user999",    // Who commented
  "content": "Totally agree!",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-30T12:05:00Z"
}


👉 Why separate? Because a tweet may have millions of comments. If we embedded inside Tweet doc, it would blow up size. MongoDB document size limit is 16MB → not good for large lists.

(d) Followers / Following

There are 2 ways:

Embedding (good for small apps):

{
  "userId": "user123",
  "followers": ["user789", "user555"],
  "following": ["user222", "user333"]
}


Separate collection (scalable like Twitter):

{
  "_id": "rel1",
  "followerId": "user123",
  "followingId": "user999",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-30T12:10:00Z"
}


👉 Why separate? Because Twitter users can have millions of followers. Embedding all into one user doc makes it too large. A separate Followers collection scales better.

(e) Likes & Retweets

Also stored in separate collections because numbers can be huge:

{
  "userId": "user123",
  "tweetId": "tweet456",
  "type": "like",   // or "retweet"
  "createdAt": "2025-08-30T12:15:00Z"
}

4. How mapping happens (relationships)

User → Tweet: via userId

Tweet → Comments: via tweetId

User → Followers: via followerId and followingId

Tweet → Likes: via tweetId

This is reference-based mapping (like foreign keys in SQL).
In queries, you use joins (in SQL) or $lookup (in MongoDB) to fetch related data.

5. Why design like this?

Efficiency:

Small documents load fast.

Big growing lists are separated.

Scalability:

Each collection can be sharded (distributed across servers).

Users with millions of followers don’t break the DB.

Flexibility:

You can add new interaction types later (like “bookmark”) without touching Tweets.

6. Which database to use?

MongoDB (NoSQL): Great for flexible schema (good for tweets, comments, dynamic media).

PostgreSQL / MySQL (SQL): Good when you need strong relationships, constraints, and reporting.

Hybrid approach: Many big apps (including Twitter, Instagram) use both:

MongoDB / Cassandra for fast scalable storage.

Postgres / MySQL for analytics, financials, strict relationships.

✅ Rule of thumb:

If data is highly relational → SQL.

If data is flexible and grows fast → NoSQL.

If you’re building a Twitter-like app → start with MongoDB for main feeds, use SQL later for analytics.
