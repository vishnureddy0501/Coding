CQRS pattern:
------------
Command Query Responsibility Segregation

insert, delete, update operations goes to one service.

Query operations in other service.


ðŸŒŸ Why Use CQRS?
	Scalability:
		You can scale reads and writes separately.
	Performance:
		Read operations can be super fast without affecting writes.
	Flexibility:
		You can use different databases for reads and writes.
	Clear Separation:
		Easier to manage complex applications where reads far exceed writes (like social media feeds).
