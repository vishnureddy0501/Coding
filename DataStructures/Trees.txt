Full Binary Tree: Every node has 2 children or 0 children
Complete Binary Tree: All levels are completely filled except the last level. 
					Last level filled from left to right.
					number of nodes in complete binary tree wiht height h : pow(2, h) - 1 (If last level is completely filled)

Perfect Binary Tree: All leaf nodes are at the same level.
Balanced Binary Tree: Max height is logN, N = number of nodes
Degenerate Tree: (Skewed tree) all the nodes to the left / all the nodes to the right.


diameter-of-binary-tree
-----------------------
try to compute in 1 traversal, while you are calculating the height of tree.

Boundary traversal of a tree?
--------------------------
traverse left boundary without leaf.
traverse leafs
traverse right boundary without leafs and revese it.

not combine 3 arrays.



important:
---------
Try to solve the problem in 1 iteration

vertical order traversal of a tree.
-----------------------------------
1. maintain  map<int, map<int, multiset<int>>> // x coordinate, y coordinate, value of node.
	Use this approach only. it is feasible for further modifications

Left view of binary tree:
------------------------
