1. Find the intersection point of y linked list.
2. Detect cycle in linked list.
3. find the length of loop
	solution: detect cycle & traverse the circle
4. find the starting point of circle.
	solution: detect cycle. 
			slow, fast collied at intersecion point.
			place slow at head.
			keep slow at intersecion point.
			mode slow, fast by 1.
			They will collide at intersecion point only.
