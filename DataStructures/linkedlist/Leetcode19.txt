Delete kth node from the end.
------------------------------
1. slow = head, fast = head;
2. do this k times. fast = fast->next;
3. now move slow, fast by 1 step.
4. by the time fast reaches end. slow reaches the node before kth node from end.
5. beforeKthNode->next = beforeKthNode->next->next;

// handle like this & check for edge cases also. think deeply
// what happens if k = 1 & k = n. // these kind of things we have to check.
