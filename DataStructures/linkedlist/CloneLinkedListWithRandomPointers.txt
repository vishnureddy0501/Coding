1. while traversing list, create a node & insert in b/w the adjacent nodes.

2. again start traversing and connect random pointers.
	node1 -> newnode1 -> node2 -> newnode2 -> node3 -> newnode3

	temp -> next->random = temp->random->next; // something like this.

3. again start traversing and connect the next pointers.


// make sure the original list, should not be modified.
