1. Once the code is done, remove the unnecessary memory
	This garbage collection happens after execution of function is done.
	eg: delete head; // something like this. it will free up the memory.


deleteHead (Node* head) {
	Node* temp = head;
	head = head->next;
	delete temp; // you can use free(temp) also
}

concept of dummy node: (for clean code if you want to return the answer in new list)
---------------------------------------
add 2 numbers (linked list)

you have to return the result in new list. always prefer dummy node concept.

take the initial dummy node with -1 as value. while doing sum append the nodes to dummy node. 

then for the finalResult return dummyNode->next.
