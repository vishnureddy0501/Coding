ðŸ”¸ When You Must Manually Delete (use delete)
--------------------------------------------
If you manually allocate memory using new, then you are responsible for freeing it using delete.

ListNode* head = new ListNode(5);
// Do stuff with head
delete head; // âœ… Must do this to avoid memory leak


ListNode* head = new ListNode(5);
ListNode* ttemp = head;
delete ttemp;



1. Once the code is done, remove the unnecessary memory
	This garbage collection happens after execution of function is done.
	eg: delete head; // something like this. it will free up the memory.


deleteHead (Node* head) {
	Node* temp = head;
	head = head->next;
	delete temp; // you can use free(temp) also
}
