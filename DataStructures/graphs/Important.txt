we can use bool array instead of int array to mark visited....it will take less memory.

Rotten oranges - follow strivers code.
Number of enclases - strivers code. 


for tress - we can use bfs/ dfs for finding shortest path.
	we can use dfs only if we have unique path to reach a node.

finding shortest path using dfs is applicable only in trees. because in trees we have unique path from a node to another node.


for graphs, for finding the shortest path we have to use bfs only.


Dfs -> runs in exponential time
Bfs -> runs in polynomial time.

Hence, we will prefer Bfs over Dfs whenever possible
