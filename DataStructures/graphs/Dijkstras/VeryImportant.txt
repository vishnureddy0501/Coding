MISCONCEPTION: we can save some space in the queue nd do queue<pair<stop,node>>  coz distance is already obtainable from dis[ ], so why maintain it specifically in the queue?

ANS: no coz in the queue we store the distance coming from a specific parent node ie a particular path , nd that path is used for further exploration when we take it out of the queue nd consider that paths distance ...but there can be other paths as well...dis[ ] can't maintain the paths, it just stores the path with minimum distance, which may not guarantee the path with least stops(which is our top priority)...hence we have to maintain the instance of the distance of a particular node in the queue


conclusion:
------------
always store distance also in priority_queue.


note: some of the algorithms in file is wrong. make the change.
