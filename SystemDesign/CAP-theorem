What is CAP theorem?
	You can only guarantee two of the following three properties at the same time:
	Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance

C — Consistency
---------------
Every read receives the most recent write (or an error).
Think: “Everyone sees the same data at the same time.”
Example: If you update your Facebook profile picture, your friend sees the new one immediately — that’s consistency.

A — Availability
----------------
Every request receives a response, even if it’s not the latest data.
The system is always up to respond.
Example: If a database node fails, another node still responds, even if it’s serving slightly old data.

P — Partition Tolerance
------------------------
The system continues to operate despite network failures that split nodes into isolated groups.

This is unavoidable in distributed systems — networks can and do fail.


In real distributed systems:
----------------------------
Partition tolerance (P) is non-negotiable (networks aren’t perfect).
So you must choose between:
	CP (Consistency + Partition tolerance) → Sacrifice availability (some requests fail during network issues).
	Example: MongoDB with majority writes.

AP (Availability + Partition tolerance) → Sacrifice consistency (may serve stale data).
Example: DynamoDB, Cassandra.
