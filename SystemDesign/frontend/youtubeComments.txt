implement comments listing in 2 ways:
-----------------------------------------------
1. after new page fetch re-render the whole list. (this is costly. but in aviso forecast cell edits, we need this approach only)
2. after new page fetch re-render only the new list & keep the old ones as it is. 
(if some person updates the already existing element in that list then you will see the stale data till page-refresh. youtube do this approach only. they are find with stale data)

How the live comments works?
---------------------------
we will set some limit on the number of comments & we show the latest 1000 comments only. remaining we don't display.

a person will post the comment. other perons also post their comments. we don't use sockets here generally. 
if it is a group chat, we can use websockets. but here no need. it is fine if we show the comments after some time. Hence poling we use generally.

Mechanism of live commenting:
------------------------------
1. poling (youtube uses this)
2. server sent events (complex to setup, costly interms on connections)
3. websockets (costly to setup the connections)

poling -> short poling, long poling

poling: frontend sends the request to check if there is any new data.
-------

there might be the cases where the frontend requests for data (poling) but we don't have new data yet in backend.

short polling: time difference b/w 2 polings is less.
--------------

long polling: time difference b/w 2 polings is more. 
-------------

poling is not good sometimes. because when we request data. there might be chances that we don't have the data.


server sent events (complex to implement, not suggested)
-----------------------------------------------------------
one way connection (backend to fronend)
server need to have a dedicated connection with the client for informing that update happened.

server sents some events to client saying that we have some latest set of comments. 
then the frontend will request for latest data. this way we don't have unncessary requests from fronend.


websockets:
------------
websockets are 2 way connection.


Live streaming protocols:
------------------------
1. WebRTC (web realtime communication)- open source, Uses UDP (there are high changes of loosing packets. not reliable)
2. RTMP - realtime messaging protocol, uses TCP, reliable, fast. (youtube uses RTMP)
