1. Rendering Largelist (virtualization)
2. Infinite scrolling & pagination
3. Handling Live Video commenting
4. Resource Optimization

Infinite scrolling & pagination
---------------------------------
done in 2 ways. 
1. offset based approach
	facebook like applications where the realtime data is changing so frequently. 
	the new new videos gets appended to the start of list. hence the page indexes keeps on changing. 

	we can't rely on this approach if data is changing frequently.

2. cursor based approach. (cursor is nothing but next pointer. think of something like linked list)
	each item has cursor. api sends the cursor to fronend. if we want to request the new data then easy to get that usin cursor.
	backend takes care of what the next cursor is. you don't have to worry.

1. using CDN(content delivery network)
2. storing images in webp format (better when compared to other formats)
3.
